<h1 id="Homework_6:_Election_Prediction">Homework 6: Meta-Homework, Election Prediction</h1>

<p>
<span style="font-size: 120%">Due: Friday, November 15th at 5:00 PM, as much as you can do
in 7 hours total (working in a group, reading, looking up on the internet, coding, talking to tutors, grading, but NOT counting class time).
This approach is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">timeboxing</a>
and requires you to develop some self-discipline and self-knowledge.
At first, it may seem unusual or uncomfortable for you to turn in work that you don't
consider complete. However, in real-life, you will not always be able to complete
your work perfectly. Everyone's abilities are at a different level, and it is more
important for you to understand your own abilities at the present moment and take
action (asking for help, or redefining the problem) than to get the right answer.
</span>
<br>
Submit your work via GitHub, with the tag <tt>hw6</tt>.
<br>
Files to turn in: <b><tt>hw6-ours.html</tt>, <tt>hw6-theirs.html</tt>, <tt>hw6.py</tt>.
.</b></p>

<p>
In this assignment, you will practice meta-learning, that is, learning about
learning. You will do this to improve the text of Homework 5 to make it clearer
as well as improve your own understanding and ability to complete Homework 5 in the future.
Homework 5 presented a steep learning curve.
By doing this homework, you will be coming up with new homework problems
to help make this learning curve more gentle for yourselves and for future students.
</p>

<p>
You are working in a group with two or three members to come up with five
sample problems that will lead someone to the solution of Homework 5,
Problem 1, which you will write in the file <tt>hw6-ours.html</tt>.
Your group will exchange problems with another group, renaming the
file you receive as <tt>hw6-theirs.html</tt>. You will work on
the problems that the other group wrote in the file <tt>hw6.py</tt>.
You will commit all three of these files to your GitHub repo, then
give the other group your repos for them to grade your work.
These steps are described in more detail in Problems 3-8 below.
You will be creating new files <tt>hw6-ours.html</tt>, <tt>hw6-theirs.html</tt> and <tt>hw6.py</tt> in your repo.
As a team, you will all work on the same files and commit the same files to your
individual GitHub repositories, tagging them as <tt>hw6</tt>.

</p>

<p>
Your group was chosen to have different levels of ability and experience.
For those of you who were able to make more progress on Homework 5,
teaching it to your teammates will help you retain the information better.
<a href="http://psi.sagepub.com/content/14/1/4.full.pdf+html?ijkey=Z10jaVH/60XQM&keytype=ref&siteid=sppsi">Studies show</a> that explaining information to yourself or others
helps you remember more information that you've learned.
You will be providing guidance to your group in identifying key concepts
that are needed by your teammates to solve Homework 5, Problem 1.
For those of you who were not able to finish the first problem of Homework 5,
getting individual help from a classmate can give quicker feedback and
an alternative explanation, in case the instructor's explanations are not
clear or delayed in time. Your job will be to help design programs together to
demonstrate the key concepts that you identify. So far you have been reading
problem descriptions and code written by the course staff. Now it is your turn to
write (simpler) versions of problem descriptions.
</p>

<p>
<b>
All members of your group will receive the same credit for this assignment.</b>
If all of you complete it as described below, you will all get credit.
If one of you does not complete all the problems, none of you will get credit.
Please help your teammates and pay attention to each other's work.
</p>

<h2>
Problem 1 (less than 1 hour)
</h2>

<p>
If you have <a href="https://github.com/blog/411-github-issue-tracker">open issues in your GitHub repository</a>, from the instructor of the TA,
respond to them with your progress on fixing them.
Even if you are not done with them, reply to the issue to let us know what is going on.
Please ask your teammates if you don't understand an issue or need help resolving it.
If no one knows how to resolve an issue, please see a tutor or come to the instructor's
office hours.
</p>

<h2>
Problem 2 (less than 1 hour)
</h2>

<p>
If you have not already committed your work from Homework 5 and created the release
<tt>hw5</tt>, do so now. Even if you have not completed any projects, commit the
files with your name and Evergreen Login at the top (Homework 5, Problem 0).
Do this before continuing any further.
Again, ask your teammates if you don't know how to create a GitHub release or to
commit your files.
</p>

<h2>
Problems 3 through 7 (3 to 4 hours)
</h2>

<p>
Download the files <tt><a href="hw6-ours.html">hw6-ours.html</a></tt> and
<tt><a href="hw6.py">hw6.py</a></tt>, add your groups
names and group number to the top, and commit them to your GitHub
repositories.
</p>

<p>
Identify five key concepts necessary to solve Homework 5, Problem 1,
then write a short Python coding problem that requires the answerer
to demonstrate understanding of this concept. This is the text
that you will put in your file <tt>hw6-ours.html</tt> under the
sections called <tt>Problem 3</tt>, <tt>Problem 4</tt>, <tt>Problem 5</tt>,
<tt>Problem 6</tt>, and <tt>Problem 7</tt>.
</p>

<p>
You may need to identify one concept and write a problem for it first,
before being able to see that another concept is itself necessary to
understand it. For an example, see <a href="hw6-ex.html">hw6-ex.html</a>,
where we have provided some sample problems. Let's say you identify
one concept, which is "Creating Nested Data Structures". So you write
Problem 4 with the title "Creating Nested Data Structures."
But in writing that
problem, you realize you need another concept, which is how to
create normal, non-nested data structures.
So you name Problem 5 "Creating non-nested Data Structures" and write
a problem for that as well.
</p>

<p>
You should not use the example problems in <tt>hw6-ex.html</tt> verbatim.
But you may change them to create similar problems, if they
describe a key concept that is blocking your teammates from understanding
Homework 5 Problem 1. You should spend about 3-4 hours on writing
these problems.
</p>

<h2>
Problem 8 (2 to 3 hours)
</h2>

<p>
Before going any further, commit your <tt>hw6-ours.html</tt> into
your GitHub repo (the same copy into each teammate's individual repo).
</p>

<p>
You will be paired with another group. Check your e-mail for your
pairings. This is the group that you will exchange
<tt>hw6-ours.html</tt> files with through whatever means is
convenient for you: either e-mail, or adding them as GitHub
collaborators. Rename the other group's
file as <tt>hw6-theirs.html</tt> and commit it to your repo.
Solve their problems by writing code into your copy of
<tt>hw6.py</tt>. Work up to the timebox (7 hours total) on these
problems.
</p>

<p>
<b>After committing and syncing your repo with GitHub,
create a tag/release called <tt>hw6</tt>.
</b>. That's it, you're done with Homework 6!
