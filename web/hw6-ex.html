Problem 3: If, Elif, and Else Statements with Mutually Exclusive Conditions
</h3>

<p>
Mutually exclusive conditions cannot be true
at the same time. An example is from the
number guessing game from lecture: either the
guess is less than the secret number, greater than,
or equal to. For mutually exclusive conditions,
it is good style to use the <tt>elif</tt> statements
in a chain, rather than creating new <tt>if</tt>
statements.
</p>

<p>
 Rewrite your
number guessing game code in <tt>hw6.py</tt> to use
one <tt>elif</tt>, one <tt>if</tt>, and one <tt>else</tt>
statement.
</p>

<h3>
Problem 4: Creating Nested Data Structures
</h3>

<p>
Data structures in Python can be nested inside each other.
For example, a set can be inside a tuple, a list can
be inside a dictionary, and any other combination you
can imagine. Create three kinds of nested
data structures:

<ul>
<li>A list containing two dictionaries.</li>
<li>A set containing three tuples.</li>
<li>A dictionary mapping tuples to lists.</li>
</p>

In each case, access one of the lowest-level elements
described below
using multiple indexing:

<ul>
<li>The last key in the second dictionary in the list.</li>
<li>The middle coordinate in the second tuple in the set.</li>
<li>The list associated with the first tuple in the dictionary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Problem 5: Creating (Non-nested) Data Structures
</h3>

<p>
Data structures (lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries)
in Python are created using different grouping
symbols. Write Python code creating one of each type
of data structure, using the correct kind of
grouping symbol (square brackets, curly braces,
parentheses, and curly braces with colons inside).
