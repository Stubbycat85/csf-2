<b>Due</b>:  at 5pm on Friday, December 6.  Commit and sync this to your github repo and tag it <code>hw8</code></p>

<p>
When you sign into Facebook, it suggests friends.  In this assignment, you
will write a program that reads Facebook data and makes friend recommendations.
</p>

<h1 id="background">Part 1:  Background</h1>


<h2 id="Recommendation_systems">Recommendation systems</h2>

<p>
Facebook suggests people you may be (or should be) friends with.  Netflix
suggests movies you might like.  Amazon suggests products to buy.  How do
they do that?  In this assignment, you will learn one simple way to make
such suggestions, called “collaborative filtering”.  The actual algorithms
used by these companies are closely-guarded trade secrets.
</p>

<p>
A computer system that makes suggestions is called a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system">recommender
system</a>.  As background, there are two general approaches:  collaborative filtering
and content-based filtering.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Collaborative filtering</b> says that, if your past
    behavior/preferences were similar to some other user's, then your
    future behavior may be as well.  As a concrete example, suppose that
    you like John, Paul, and George, and other people like John, Paul,
    George, and Ringo.  Then it stands to reason that you will like Ringo
    as well, even if you had never previously heard of him.  The
    recommender system does not have to understand anything about what
    “John”, “Paul”, “George”, and “Ringo” are — they could even be
    brands of toilet paper, and the algorithm would work identically.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Content-based filtering</b> considers the characteristics of the
    things you like, and it recommends similar sorts of things.  For
    instance, if you like “Billie Jean”, “Crazy Train”, and “Don't Stop the
    Music”, then you might like other songs in the key of F-sharp minor,
    such as Rachmaninoff's “Piano Concerto No. 1”, even if no one else has
    ever had that particular set of favorite songs before.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In this assignment, you will implement a  collaborative filtering
recommendation system for suggesting friends on Facebook.
</p>



<h2 id="Representing_a_social_network_as_a_graph">Representing a social network as a graph</h2>

<p>
A <em>graph</em> or <em>network</em> represents relationships among things.
The things are represented as <em>nodes</em> or <em>vertices</em>, and the
relationships are represented as <em>edges</em>.
</p>

<p>
One common use for a graph is to represent travel possibilities, such as on
a road map or airline map.  The nodes of the graph are cities, and the
edges show which cities are directly connected.  Then, you can use the
graph to plan travel.
</p>

<p>
<img src="./hw8-social_files/northeast-roads.gif" alt="Northeast roads" width="49%">
<img src="./hw8-social_files/ThinkingNetworks-airline.gif" alt="Airline network" width="49%">
</p>

<p>
Another common use for a graph is to represent friendship among people in a
social network.  For example, here is the friendship graph for some of the
characters of “Romeo and Juliet”:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./hw8-social_files/romeo-and-juliet-undirected.png" alt="Romeo and Juliet social network" id="rj-graph">
</p>

<p>
An edge between person <em>A</em> and person <em>B</em> means that
<em>A</em> considers <em>B</em> a friend, and also <em>B</em> considers
<em>A</em> a friend.
</p>

<p>
This graph is unable to represent certain information.  For example, Count
Paris wishes to wed Juliet, but she does not reciprocate his affection.
You do not need to worry about this information, because Facebook does not
represent this information either.  (Some other social networking sites,
such as Twitter and Google+, do permit one-way links.)
</p>

<!-- Directed version
<p>
Notice that the edges are <em>directed</em>.  An edge from person
<em>A</em> to person <em>B</em> means that <em>A</em> considers <em>B</em>
a friend.  When this relationship is mutual, there are two arrows, 
one <em>A</em>&rarr;<em>B</em> and one <em>B</em>&rarr;<em>A</em>.  The
relationship does not have to be mutual:  Count Paris wishes to wed Juliet,
but she does not reciprocate his affection.  (Facebook does not represent
this information:  for each pair of users, either both arrows are present,
or neither is.  Therefore, you do not need to worry about this information.)
</p>
-->

<p>
In the image above, ignore the gray background and the labels for the
families ("houses");
those are there just to help you interpret the graph but are not part
of the social network itself.
</p>


<h2 id="Recommending_friends">Recommending friends</h2>

<p>
You will implement two mechanisms for recommending a new friend in a
social network.  A simple way to state this question is, “For user X, who is
the best person to recommend as a friend?”
</p>

<p>
You will answer a more comprehensive question:  “For user X, list some
<em>non-friends</em> in order, starting with the best friend
recommendation and ending with the worst.”  A non-friend is a user who is
not X and is not a friend of X.
Depending on the recommendation algorithm, the list may include all
non-friends or some of them.
</p>

<p>
For example, for Mercutio the list might be:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capulet<br>Montague<br>Benvolio<br>Friar Laurence<br>Juliet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Further note that the recommendations might not be symmetric:  the best
friend recommendation for Montague might be Mercutio, but the best
friend recommendation for Mercutio might be Capulet.
</p>

<p>
Your task will be to write code that, given a user U in the social network,
produces friend recommendations for U, in order from best to worst.
You will do this by assigning each potential friend a number called a score, where higher
scores indicate a better match.  Then you can sort your list according to
the score.
Given user X, if two people Y and Z would be equally good as new friends
for X (they have the same score), then they should be listed in
alphabetical order (for names) or numerical order (for numerical user IDs).
</p>


<h2 id="Representing_a_graph_in_Python">Representing a graph in Python</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a> library represents a
graph in Python.  Work through the
<a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html">NetworkX
tutorial</a>, up to and including the
<a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html#accessing-edges">Accessing
  edges</a> section.
<!-- , and also optionally the
  <a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html#drawing-graphs">Drawing
  graphs</a> section.
-->
  In order for you to use this powerful library
effectively, it's important that you actually do the exercises:  type the inputs and
understand the outputs.
</p>

<p>
To use the <tt>networkx</tt> library in a program, write <tt>import
networkx</tt> or <tt>import
networkx as nx</tt> near the top of your program.  The latter has already been done for
you in the supplied <tt>social_network.py</tt>, so you can use shorter
commands like <tt>nx.draw(...)</tt> instead of the (slightly longer)
<tt>networkx.draw(...)</tt>.
</p>


<h1 id="part-2">Part 2: Test on a small graph</h1>

<h2 id="create-graphs">Problem 1: Create graphs</h2>

<p>
It is always a good idea to test your code on a dataset
that is small enough for you to manually compute the results.
You will create two such datasets for testing.
</p>

<h3 id="create-practice-graph">Problem 1a:  A small practice graph</h3>

<p>
<img src="./hw8-social_files/practice_graph.png" alt="Imaginary social network" width="500">
</p>
    
<p>
Create the above graph, and store it in a variable named
<tt>practice_graph</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Use the
<a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/classes.graph.html"><tt>Graph</tt></a>
class (not DiGraph, MultiGraph, or MultiDiGraph).  Review its documentation
before you begin.
</p>

<p>
To help you verify that your graph is correct, the provided code
<a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html#drawing-graphs">draws the
    graph</a> to a window.  Compare your graph to the figure above. The
nodes may appear in different locations; that's fine so long as the same
nodes exist and they are connected in the same way by the edges.
</p>

<p>
Note that your program will pause until you close the window that contains
the the graph drawing.
</p>

<p>
When you are happy with your graph, comment out the call
<tt>draw_practice_graph()</tt> call (not the definition of the
<tt>draw_practice_graph</tt> function).  The reason is so that you don't
have to close the window every time you run your program.
</p>


<h3 id="create-rj-graph">Problem 1b:  The Romeo and Juliet graph</h3>

<p>
Create a graph named <tt>rj</tt> corresponding to the <a href="#rj-graph">Romeo and Juliet graph</a> above (ignoring the shaded family/house information).  
</p>

<p>
To help you verify that your graph is correct, the provided code
<a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html#drawing-graphs">draws the
    graph</a> to a window and to a file <tt>romeo-and-juliet.pdf</tt>.
Compare your graph to the Romeo and Juliet graph above. The
nodes may appear in different locations; that's fine so long as the same
nodes exist and they are connected in the same way by the edges.
</p>

<p>
When you are happy with your graph and the <tt>romeo-and-juliet.pdf</tt>
file, comment out the call <tt>draw_rj()</tt> call (not the definition of
the <tt>draw_rj</tt> function).
The reason is so that you don't have to close the window every time you run
your program.
</p>


<!--

Save your plot in file <tt>romeo-and-juliet.pdf</tt>, using the
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.savefig"><tt>savefig</tt></a>
command.<br />
<b>Note</b>:  Calling
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.show"><tt>show()</tt></a>
not only displays the graph (which enables you to view it and double-check its
correctness), but also clears the
current figure (equivalently, creates a new figure).  Therefore, when you
wish to save your figure to a file, you should either place the call to
<tt>savefig()</tt> before the call to <tt>show()</tt>, or remove the call
to <tt>show()</tt>.
</p>

-->


<h2 id="numfriends-rj">Problem 2:  Recommend by number of common friends</h2>

<p>
If non-friend Y is your friend's friend, then maybe Y should be your friend
too.  If person Y is the friend of many of your friends, then Y is an even
better recommendation.  The best friend recommendation is the person with
whom you have the largest number of mutual friends.
You will implement this heuristic.
</p>
 
<p>
As a concrete example, consider "A" in <tt>practice_graph</tt>.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    A has one friend in common with B (namely, C).<br>
    A has one friend in common with C (namely, B).<br>
    A has two friends in common with D (namely, B and C).<br>
    A has no friends in common with E.<br>
    A has one friend in common with F (namely, C).
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, consider Mercutio in the <a href="#rj-graph">Romeo and Juliet graph</a>.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mercutio has two friends in common with Capulet (Escalus and Paris).<br>
Mercutio has two friends in common with Montague (Escalus and Romeo).<br>
Mercutio has one friend in common with Benvolio (Romeo).<br>
Mercutio has one friend in common with Friar Laurence (Romeo).<br>
Mercutio has one friend in common with Juliet (Romeo).<br>
Mercutio has no friends in common with the Nurse.<br>
Mercutio has no friends in common with Tybalt.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Therefore, Capulet and Montague are the best friend recommendations for
Mercutio, and the Nurse and Tybalt are the worst friend recommendations.
(In fact, the Nurse and Tybalt are such poor friend recommendations that
your program will not even suggest them.)
</p>

<p>
Write the following 5 functions, whose documentation strings appear in the
template file <tt>social_network.py</tt> that you were provided.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>friends_of_friends</tt></li>
  <li><tt>common_friends</tt></li>
  <li><tt>number_of_common_friends_map</tt></li>
  <li><tt>number_map_to_sorted_list</tt></li>
  <li><tt>recommend_by_number_of_common_friends</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
The template file defines a helper function, <tt>friends(graph, user)</tt>,
that you may find useful.
</p>

<p>
The template file also contains <tt>assert</tt> statements to help you test
your code.  We strongly encourage you to <b>write additional tests</b> as well,
in order to verify that your code is correct.
</p>

<p>
Hint:  Remember that when Python
tests sets or dictionaries for equality, it ignores the order of elements.
A consequence of this is that two sets can print differently but be equal
because they represent the same set, and likewise for dictionaries.
For example, this Python expression evaluates to <tt>True</tt>:
</p>
<pre>{ 'Capulet', 'Escalus', 'Montague' } == { 'Montague', 'Capulet', 'Escalus' }
</pre>

<p>
Hint:  Throughout this assignment, you are permitted, but not required, to
define additional functions beyond the required ones.
</p>

<p>
Hints for <tt>friends_of_friends</tt> and <tt>common_friends</tt>:  When
defining these routines, you should not use any data structures other than
sets.  If you find yourself using even one list or dictionary, then you are
doing the problem wrong.  The reason to use sets is that the code is much
shorter and simpler.  In fact, a good solution to 
<tt>friends_of_friends</tt> is 4 lines long, and a good solution to 
<tt>common_friends</tt> is 1 line long.  Longer solutions are possible and
can also be good style, but the point is that these are small, simple
functions.  The other functions you will define are little, if any, longer.
</p>

<p>
Hints for <tt>number_map_to_sorted_list</tt>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may want to use the <tt>key</tt> argument to the <tt>sort</tt>
      routine.  Furthermore, you may find the
      <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter"><tt>operator.itemgetter</tt></a>
      routine useful as the key argument.
      For details, see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/howto/sorting.html">Python Sorting HowTo</a>.
  </li>
  <li>There are multiple ways to sort primarily on criterion
      c1, and to sort on criterion c2 wherever c1 does not make a distinction.
      One way is to first sort with respect to c2, then sort with
      respect to c1.  This works because when Python sorts, it retains the
      ordering of any items whose sort keys are equal.
      (Another way is to use, as the sort key, a tuple/list of all the
      sort criteria.  A way to do this is with a key expression like
      <tt>itemgetter(1, 0)</tt>.  This works because Python, when comparing
      a tuple/list, does so <em>lexicographically</em> (element-by-element,
      stopping when there is any difference.)
      For details, see the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting/#Sort_Stability_and_Complex_Sorts">Python Sorting HowTo</a>.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="influence-rj">Problem 3:  Recommend by influence</h2>

<p>
We will now give a different algorithm for computing a friendship score.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following hypothetical situation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Two of your friends are J.D. Salinger and Tim Kinsella.<br>
J.D. Salinger has only two friends (you and one other person).<br>
Tim Kinsella has 7 billion friends.<br>
J.D. and Tim have no friends in common (besides you).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since
J.D. is highly selective in terms of friendship, and is a friend of yours,
you are likely to have a lot in common with J.D.'s other friend.  On the
other hand, Tim is indiscriminate and there is little reason to believe
that you should be friendly with any particular one of Tim's other friends.
</p>

<p>
Incorporate the above idea into your friend recommendation algorithm.
Here is the concrete way that you will do so.  We call the technique
“influence scoring”.<br>
Suppose that user1 and user2 have three friends in common: f1, f2, and f3.
In <a href="#numfriends-rj">Problem 2</a>, the score for user2 as a friend of user1 is 1+1+1:  each
common friend contributes 1 to the score.
In this problem, the score for user2 as a friend of user1 is
1/numfriends(f1) + 1/numfriends(f2) + 1/numfriends(f3), where numfriends(f)
is the number of friends that f has.  In other words, each friend <em>F</em> of user1
has a total influence score of 1 to contribute, and divides it equally among all of
<em>F</em>'s friends.
</p>

<p>
In the example above, J.D. Salinger's other friend would have a score of
1/2, and each of Tim Kinsella's friends would have a score of
1/7000000000.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>social_network.py</tt> file gives two
functions (<tt>influence_map</tt> and <tt>recommend_by_influence</tt>)
that you should implement.  You may find that their implementations are
quite similar to code that you have already written in Problem 2; that is OK.
The file also gives one test case for each of the two functions.
</p>

<p>
Do not change the code that you wrote for <a href="#numfriends-rj">Problem
2</a>.  However, you can reuse most of it.  You can solve the problem with
just the two new functions (<tt>influence_map</tt> and
<tt>recommend_by_influence</tt>), plus re-using some unchanged functions
from Problem 2.
</p>


<h2 id="compare-recommendation-algorithm-rj">Problem 4: Does the recommendation algorithm make a difference?</h2>

<p>
Does the change of recommendation algorithm make any difference?
Maybe not:  you can see that
Mercutio gets the same friend recommendations with both recommendation
approaches.
Does everyone get identical results with the two recommendation approaches?
</p>

<p>
Write code to print a list of people for whom the two approaches make the
same recommendations, then print a list of people for whom the two
approaches make different recommendations.  Each list should be sorted in
alphabetical order.</p>
    
    <p>Print output format:</p>
<pre>Unchanged recommendations: ['name', 'name', ...]
Changed recommendations: ['name', 'name', ...]
</pre>

    
<p>Paste the output into an
<tt>answers.txt</tt> file, which you will create.
</p>

<p>
Hint:  There are 5 people for whom the recommendations are the same, and 6
people for whom the recommendations are different.
</p>


<h2 id="analyze-algorithm">Problem 5: Analysis of the algorithm</h2>

<p>
In <a href="#numfriends-rj">Problem 2</a>, every friend recommendation had a score of 1 or more.
In <a href="#influence-rj">Problem 3</a>, every friend recommendation had a score of less than 1.
Will that always be the case?
</p>

<p>
In your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file, state whether each influence score will always be
less than 1.  If your answer is “yes”, explain why.  If your answer is
“no”, then give the smallest graph that you can that has a friend influence
score of 1 or greater.  In either case, you do not have to write any code
— all your answers will appear in your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file.
</p>


<h2 id="random-friend-connection">Problem 6: Randomly choosing a friend connection</h2>

<p>
Suppose that you wanted to randomly choose a friend connection
from a social network.  Here are two ways to do this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Obtain a list of all the friend connections, and randomly choose one
    of those.</li>
  <li>Randomly choose a user in the social network, then randomly choose
      one of their friends. Here, "randomly" means a uniform probability of selecting each element.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The former makes each choice of friend connection equally likely.
The latter does not necessarily do so.
</p>

<p>
In your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file, describe the smallest graph that you can
for which the two approaches lead to different results.  In other words,
the first approach leads to each edge in the social network graph being
chosen with equal probability, and the second approach leads to some edges
being more probably to be chosen than others.  State the probability of each
edge in your example graph being chosen, when using the latter approach.
</p>

<p>
There is no code to write for this question.  Just write your solution in
<tt>answers.txt</tt>
</p>

<p>
Hint:  If you are having trouble, then start with the simplest possible
graph, compute the probabilities, and make the graph incrementally more
complicated until you find the example you seek.
</p>


<h2 id="evaluate-recommendations-rj">Problem 7: How good are your recommendations?</h2>

<p>
We have seen that the two recommendation systems give different results.
Which one is better?
</p>

<p>
You will test the two recommendation systems in the following way:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Randomly choose a real friend connection; call the two friends F1 and F2.
  </li>
  <li>Remove their friendship from the graph.</li>
  <li>Compute friend recommendations for F1 and F2.</li>
  <li>Determine the rank of F1 in F2's list of recommended friends.<br>
      Determine the rank of F2 in F1's list of recommended friends.<br>
      If either of these does not exist (e.g., F1 is not recommended as one
      of F2's friends), discard the F1-F2 pair from your experiment.<br>
      Otherwise, average these two numbers.<br>
      The "rank" is also known as the "index" or "position".  It starts
      counting at <b>1</b>, not 0.
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
For a perfect recommendation system, the first recommendation for F1 would
be F2, and the first recommendation for F2 would be F1.  In general, the
closer to the front of the list these recommendations are, the better the
recommendation system.
</p>

<p>
For each recommendation system, perform the above experiment 100 times,
using the Romeo and Juliet data.
Compute the average rank of the correct recommendation within the
list of recommendations.  (If the correct recommendation does not appear
within the list of recommendations, ignore that trial when computing the
average rank.)
</p>

<p>
To prevent different random choices from skewing your
results, use the <em>same</em> random choices for both recommendation systems.
Another way of saying this is that each time you make a random choice, you
should evaluate both recommendation systems using that choice.  Then go on
to the next choice.  Every run of your program will produce slightly
different average ranks, but your program should be consistent in terms of
which method is better.
</p>

<p>
Ensure that your code is general.  Write it as a function that takes a
graph as an input, then call that function.  You will re-use the function
in <a href="#evaluate-recommendations-facebook">Problem 12</a>.
</p>
    
    <p>Print output format:</p>
<pre>Average rank of influence method: ___
Average rank of number of friends in common method: ___
___ method is better.
</pre>
    
<p>
Hint:  The average rank will be around 2.
</p>

<p>
Ensure that your code is documented.  In your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file,
give the average index for each recommendation system.
State which recommendation system is better for the <tt>rj</tt> graph.
</p>

<p>
Hint:  To select a random element from a list, use the function
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.choice"><tt>random.choice</tt></a>.

<h1 id="part-3">Part 3:  Work with the Facebook graph</h1>


<h2 id="create-graph-facebook">Problem 8: Create a Facebook graph</h2>

<p>
Create a graph named <tt>facebook</tt> from the Facebook data in file
<tt>facebook-links.txt</tt>.
As above, use the
<a href="http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/classes.graph.html"><tt>Graph</tt></a>
class.
</p>

<p>
Print the number of nodes and the number of edges in your <tt>facebook</tt>
graph.  The output should be:
</p>
<pre>Facebook nodes: 63731
Facebook edges: 817090
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>facebook-links.txt</tt> file in your <tt>homework4</tt> directory 
is courtesy of the <a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/index.php">Max Planck Institute
  for Software Systems</a>.  Here is a slightly clarified version of the
<a href="http://socialnetworks.mpi-sws.org/data-wosn2009.html">documentation
  for this file</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
File <tt>facebook-links.txt</tt> contains a list of all of the user-to-user
links from the Facebook New Orleans networks.
These links are undirected on Facebook.
</p>

<p>
Format:  Each line contains two numeric user identifiers, meaning the
second user appeared in the first user's friend list, <em>and</em> 
the first user appeared in the second user's friend list. Finally, the third
column is a UNIX timestamp with the time of link establishment (if it could
be determined, otherwise it is '\N').
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.  You may
ignore it in this assignment.  (Facebook does use the
recency of your activity to help it in making recommendations.)
</p>

<!--
Don't even mention this to the students, and hope that they don't even
notice it.  It should not affect them.  (It did weird me out when I was
validating my solution.)

<p>
The <tt>facebook-links.txt</tt> file sometimes lists an edge in both
directions; for example, it contains both of these lines:
</p>
<pre>
1	10	\N
10	1	\N
</pre>
-->


<!--
Do not make this suggestion.  It's almost as easy to read
the .txt file directly, and doing so does not require the students to learn
a new Python package.
<p>
Hint: Python's
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html"><tt>csv</tt></a> module
makes it easy to read the <tt>facebook-links.txt</tt> file.  Alternately, you
can solve this problem without using the <tt>csv</tt> module.
</p>
-->

<p>
Hint:
Don't be alarmed if reading the Facebook data takes a little while.  The
file is large, and reading it may take up to a minute.
However, do not try to draw the Facebook graph.  This may cause your
computer to hang, and even if it were successful, you would not learn much
from a tangled mess of 817,090 edges.
</p>



<h2 id="numfriends-facebook">Problem 9:  Recommend by number of friends for Facebook</h2>

<p>
For every Facebook user with an id that is a multiple of 1000, print a list
containing the first 10 friend recommendations, as determined by number of
common friends.
If there are fewer than 10 recommendations, print all the recommendations.
</p>
    
<p>Print output format:</p>
<pre>...
28000 ['17125', '7033', '15462', '33049', '51105', '16424', '23', '7996', '1539', '17420']
29000 ['28606']
30000 ['14473', '14495', '17951', '19611', '22749', '23259', '30002', '3154', '8269', '862']
...
</pre>
    
<p>
(The above is actual output for the <tt>recommend_by_influence</tt>
approach.  Your output for the <tt>recommend_by_number_of_common_friends</tt>
approach will differ, but will use the same general formatting.)
</p>

<p>
Paste the output into <tt>answers.txt</tt> file.
</p>


<h2 id="influence-facebook">Problem 10:  Recommend by influence for Facebook</h2>

<p>
For every Facebook user with an id that is a multiple of 1000, print a list
containing the first 10 friend recommendations, as determined by influence
score.  
If there are fewer than 10 recommendations, print all the recommendations.
</p>

<p>
Output format is the same as in Problem 9. Paste the output into your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file.
</p>

<h2 id="compare-recommendation-algorithm-facebook">Problem 11: Does the recommendation algorithm make a difference for Facebook?</h2>

<p>
Considering only those 63 Facebook users with an id that is a multiple of
1000, compute and print the number of Facebook users who have the same
first 10 friend recommendations under both recommendation systems, and the
number of Facebook users who have different first 10 friend recommendations
under the two recommendation systems. This program will take some time to compute (at least a couple of minutes).
</p>

    <p>Print output format:</p>
<pre>Same: __, Different: __
</pre>
    
<p>
Paste the output into your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file.
</p>


<h2 id="evaluate-recommendations-facebook">Problem 12: How good are your recommendations for Facebook?</h2>

<p>
Repeat the procedure you followed for
<a href="#evaluate-recommendations-rj">Problem 7</a>, but for the Facebook
data.
</p>

<p>
In your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file,
give the average index for each recommendation system.
State which recommendation system is better for the <tt>facebook</tt> graph.
</p>
    
    
    <p>Print output format:</p>
<pre>Average rank of influence method: ___
Average rank of number of friends in common method: ___
___ method is better.
</pre>

<p>
Hint:  The average indices should be in the 100-400 range.  This is because
the social network is very large, you are using very impoverished data
(just existing connections) and you are looking for one specific
“right” answer (even though in real life many of the
recommendations are probably useful).
</p>

<p>
Note:
You will evaluate the recommendation systems on 100
randomly-chosen edges out of the 817,090 edges in the Facebook graph.
If you were to choose 100 different randomly-chosen
edges, you would get different results.
The answers are likely to be informative nonetheless.
If you choose 100 edges at random, it is unlikely that you will make an
unlucky choice, such that technique 1 is better than technique 2 for those
100 edges, but technique 2 is better than technique 1 overall.  It's still
a possibility, of course.  The more edges you choose at random, the less
likely you are to be unlucky in that way.
We asked you to do the evaluation on 100 randomly-chosen edges because
your code would be very slow if you used (say) 1000 choices.
