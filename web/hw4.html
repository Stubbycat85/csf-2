<h1>Homework 4:  DNA analysis (Part 2)</h1>

<p>
<b>Due</b>: at 5pm on Friday, November 3rd.
Create a release of your homework submission as <code>hw4</code>.
</p>

<p>
You will continue your solution from <a href="hw3.html">Homework 3</a>
about computing the GC content of DNA
data. Read that homework again to remind yourself of the problem background.
</p>


<h2 id="problem5">Problem 5: Count nucleotides</h2>

<p>
Augment your program so that it also computes and prints the number of 
A nucleotides, the number of T nucleotides, the number of G nucleotides,
and the number of C nucleotides.
</p>

<p>
When doing this, add at most one extra loop to your program.  You can solve
this part without adding any new loops at all, by reusing an existing loop.
</p>

<p>
Check your work by manually computing the results for file
<tt>test-small.fastq</tt>, then comparing them to the output of running your
program on <tt>test-small.fastq</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Run your program on <tt>sample_1.fastq</tt>. Cut-and-paste the relevant lines
of output into <tt>answers.txt</tt> (the lines that indicate the G count, C
count, A count, and T count).
</p>



<h2 id="problem6">Problem 6: Sanity-check the data</h2>

<p>
For each of the 11 <tt>.fastq</tt> files, compare the following three quantities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the sum of the A count, the C count, the G count, and the T count
  </li>
  <li>the <tt>total_count</tt> variable
  </li>
  <li>the length of the <tt>seq</tt> variable.  You can compute this with <tt>len(seq)</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words, compute the three numbers for <tt>test-small.fastq</tt>
and determine whether they are equal or different.  Then do the same for 
<tt>test-high-gc-1.fastq</tt>, etc.
</p>

<p>
For at least one file, at least two of these metrics will differ.  In your
<tt>answers.txt</tt> file, state which file(s) and which metrics.
(If all the metrics are equal for each file, then your code contains a mistake.)
In your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file, write a short paragraph that explains why.
</p>

<p>
Explaining why (or debugging your code if all the metrics were the same)
might require you to do some detective work.  For instance, to understand
the issue, you may need to load a file into a text editor and examine it.
We strongly suggest that you start with the smallest file for which the
numbers are not all the same.  Perusal of the file may help you.  Failing
that, you can manually compute each of the counts, and then compare your
manual results to what your program computes to determine where the error
lies.  A final approach would be to modify your program, or create a new
program, to compute the three metrics for each line of a file separately:
if the metrics differ for an entire file, then they must differ for some
specific line, and then examining that line will help you understand the
problem.
</p>

<p>
If all of the three quantities that you measured in
<a href="file:///Users/ppham/src/cse140/13wi/assignments/2-dna-analysis/homework2.html#problem6">problem 6</a> are the same, then it would not matter
which one you used in the denominator when computing the GC content. In
fact, you saw that the numbers are not the same.  In file
<tt>answers.txt</tt>, state which of these quantities can be used in the
denominator and which cannot, and why.
</p>

<p>
<em>If</em> your program incorrectly computed the GC content (which should be
equal to (G+C)/(A+C+G+T)), then state that fact in your <tt>answers.txt</tt>
file.  Then, go back and correct it, and also update any incorrect answers
elsewhere in your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file.
</p>


<h2 id="problem7">Problem 7: Compute the AT/GC ratio</h2>

<p>
Sometimes biologists use the AT/GC ratio, defined as (A+T)/(G+C), rather
than the GC-content, which is defined as (G+C)/(A+C+G+T).
</p>

<p>
Modify your program so that it also computes the AT/GC ratio.
</p>

<p>
Check your work by manually computing the results for file
<tt>test-small.fastq</tt>. Compare them to the output of running your
program on <tt>test-small.fastq</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Run your program on <tt>sample_1.fastq</tt>. Cut-and-paste the relevant lines
of output into <tt>answers.txt</tt> (the line that indicates the AT/GC ratio).
</p>


<h2 id="problem8">Problem 8: Categorize organisms</h2>

<p>
The GC content can be used to categorize microorganisms.<br>
Modify your program to print out a classification of the organism in the file.<br>
If the GC content is above 60%, the organism is considered “high GC content”.<br>
If the GC content is below 40%, the organism is considered “low GC content”.<br>
Otherwise, the organism is considered “moderate GC content”.
</p>

<p>
Biologists can use GC content for classifying species, for determining the
melting temperature of the DNA (useful for both ecology and
experimentation, for example
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> is
more difficult on organisms with high
GC content), and for other purposes.  Here are some examples:<br>
The GC content of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is 72%.<br>
The GC content of Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is 38%.<br>
The GC content of Thale Cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) is 36%.<br>
The GC content of Plasmodium falciparum is 20%.
</p>

<p>
Again, test your work.  The <tt>test-small.fastq</tt> file has low GC
content.  We have provided four other test files, whose names explain
their GC content: <tt>test-moderate-gc-1.fastq</tt>,
<tt>test-moderate-gc-2.fastq</tt>, <tt>test-high-gc-1.fastq</tt>,
<tt>test-high-gc-2.fastq</tt>.
</p>

<p>
After your program works for all the test files, run it on
<tt>sample_1.fastq</tt>. Cut-and-paste just the relevant line of output from
your program into <tt>answers.txt</tt>.
</p>


<h2 id="submit">Collaboration and Reflection</h2>

<p>
You are almost done!
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file, in the “Collaboration”
part, state which students or
other people (besides the course staff) helped you with the assignment, or
that no one did.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of your <tt>answers.txt</tt> file, in the “Reflection” part,
reflect on this assignment.
  What did you learn from this assignment?  What do you wish you had known
  before you started?  What would you do differently?  What advice would
  you offer to future students?
