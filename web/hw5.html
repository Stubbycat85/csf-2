<h2 id="intro-and-background">Introduction and background</h2>

<h3 id="pundits-v-statisticians">Election prediction:  pundits vs. statisticians</h3>

<p>
In the past, the outcome of political campaigns was predicted by political
analysts and pundits, using a combination of their experience, intuition, and
personal biases and preferences.  In recent decades there has been a shift to a 
more scientific approach, in which election results are predicted
statistically using a poll. A small random sample of voters is asked how they
will vote, and from that the result of the entire election is extrapolated.
</p>

<p>
The 2012 presidential election was a watershed in the fight between pundits
and statisticians. The rivalry became front-page news, with many pundits
loudly proclaiming that the statisticians would be humiliated on November
6.  In fact, the opposite happened: statistician Nate Silver (of the
website <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>)
correctly predicted the outcome in every state, whereas pundits' predictions
varied significantly. Literally dozens of prominent political analysts had
predicted a Romney win. Other pundits said the election was “too close to call”,
though Silver and other statisticians had been predicting an Obama win for
months. These results changed the way many Americans view political commentators,
revealing them as entertainers but not as reliable sources of information.
</p>

<p>
How did Nate Silver do it?  In this assignment, you will find out, and you
will replicate his results by using polling data to predict the outcome of
the 2012 US presidential election.
</p>

<h3 id="election-polls-trust">Election polls:  Which ones to trust?</h3>

<p>
An <b>election poll</b> is a survey that asks a small sample of voters how
they plan to vote.  If the sample of voters is representative of the voting
population at large, then the poll predicts the result of the entire
election.  In practice, a poll's prediction must be taken with a grain of
salt, because the sample is only <em>approximately</em> representative of
the voting population.  (See below for an explanation of why.)
</p>

<p>
For example, in late October 2012, the Gallup poll consistently gave Romney
a 6-percentage-point lead in the popular vote, but in fact Obama won the
popular vote by 2.6 percentage points.  On the other hand, RAND Corporation
was biased toward the Democrats and tended to overstate Obama's lead by 1.5
percentage points.  How can you decide which polls to rely upon?  Depending
on which poll you trust, you might make a very different prediction.
</p>

<p>
One approach is to average together the different polls.  This is better
than trusting any one of them, but it is still rather crude.  What if most
of them are biased?  That was the case for the 23 organizations that
conducted at least 5 polls in the last 21 days of the 2012 Presidential
campaign:  19 of the 23 organizations gave a result that favored
Republicans more than the actual results did.  Nonetheless, Nate Silver's
prediction was very close to correct, and showed no bias toward either party.
</p>

<p>
Silver's approach is very sophisticated, but its key idea is to combine
different polls using a <em>weighted average</em>.  In a normal average,
each data point contributes equally to the result.  In a weighted average,
some data points contribute more than others.  Silver examined how well
each polling organization had predicted previous elections, and then weighted
their polls according to their accuracy:  more biased pollsters had less
effect on the weighted average.
</p>

<p>The general structure of FiveThirtyEight's algorithm is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the average error of each pollster's predictions for previous 
elections. This is known as the pollster's <b>rank</b>. A smaller rank
indicates a more accurate pollster.</li>
<li>
Transform each <b>rank</b> into a <b>weight</b> (for use in a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean">weighted average</a>).
A larger weight indicates a more accurate pollster. FiveThirtyEight 
considers a number of factors when computing a weight, including rank, sample 
size, and when a poll was conducted. For this assignment, we simply set
<b>weight</b> to equal the inverse square of <b>rank</b>
(<tt>weight = rank**(-2)</tt>).<br>
</li>
<li>In each state, perform a weighted average of predictions made by pollsters.
This predicts the winner in that state.
</li>
<li>Calculate the outcome of the Electoral
  College, using the per-state predictions.
  The candidate with the most electoral votes wins the election.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The algorithm is described in more detail at the 
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/methodology/">FiveThirtyEight blog</a>.
You do not have to read or understand this information to complete this assignment, but
you may find it interesting nonetheless.

<h3 id="electoral-college">The US Electoral College</h3>

<p>
We have given you an implementation of the <tt>electoral_college_outcome</tt> function, so
this section is for your information but you do not need it while writing
code for your assignment.
</p>

<p>Here is information about US Presidential elections and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)">US
Electoral College</a>, paraphrased from Wikipedia:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">The President of the
United States is not elected directly by the voters. Instead, the President
is elected indirectly by “electors” who are selected by popular vote on a
state-by-state basis.  Each state has as many electors as members of
Congress. There are 538 electors, based on Congress having 435
representatives and 100 senators, plus three electors from the District of
Columbia.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Electors are selected on a
“winner-take-all” basis. That is, all electoral votes go to the
presidential candidate who wins the most votes in the state.
(Actually, Maine and Nebraska use a slightly different method, but for
simplicity in this assignment, we will assume they use the
“winner-take-all” approach.)
</p>

<p>
Our analysis only considers the Democratic and Republican political
parties.  This is a reasonable simplification, since a third-party
candidate has received an electoral vote only once in the past 60 years (in
1968, George Wallace won 8% of the electoral vote).
</p>


<h3 id="why-polls-are-approximate">Why polls are approximate</h3>

<p>
This section of the handout explains why poll results are only approximate,
and how poll aggregation helps.
</p>

<p>
Recall that a poll sample is only <em>approximately</em> representative of
the voting population.  There are two reasons for this:  sampling error and
pollster bias.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Sampling error:</b>
    If you randomly choose a sample from a population, then random chance
    may cause the sample to differ from the population.  The US population
    is 50.7% female and 49.3% male, 
    <!-- In 2009, 155.6 million females (50.7%),  151.4 million males (49.3%). -->
    but a random sample of 1000 individuals
    might include 514 females and 486 males or 496 females and 504 males.
    An extrapolation from the sample to the entire population would be
    slightly incorrect.  The larger the sample, the more likely it is to be
    representative of the population.

    <p>
    Sampling error is unavoidable, but it can be reduced by increasing the
    sample size.  This is one reason that poll aggregation can be successful:
    it effectively uses a larger sample than any one individual poll.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pollster bias or “house effects”:</b>
    These are systematic inaccuracies caused by faulty methodology —
    essentially, the pollster has <em>not</em> chosen a random sample of US
    voters.  Suppose that a pollster sampled only Mormons or only
    African-Americans; it would be meaningless to predict the overall
    vote from these biased samples.
    Actual pollster bias comes in subtler forms, and can be a
    positive or a negative factor.  
    Here are some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Not all Americans vote, so each polling firm should adjust its
        sampling to select not among all Americans, but among likely
        voters.  Poor people and young people are are less likely to vote,
        so a polling firm might adjust its statistics to account for that,
        but the firm might over- or undercompensate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Survey response rates are typically lowest in urban areas, so
        unweighted samples routinely under-represent black and Hispanic
        Americans who frequently live in urban areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some telephone polls call only landline numbers, but 1/3 of
        Americans rely on cellphones — and they are younger, more urban,
        poorer, and more likely to be black and Hispanic, all of which
        correlate with Democratic voting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Question wording and order has a significant effect on responses.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Pollster bias is avoidable by improving methodology —
    or, if you can determine a pollster's bias, you can adjust their scores
    accordingly and use the adjusted scores rather than what the pollster
    reports.  That is what Nate Silver and other “poll aggregators” did
    — even without knowing the specific sources of bias.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a Python program that predicts the outcome
of the 2012 US Presidential election, based on polling data and results
from the 2012 and 2008 elections.  The
overall program has already been designed, including deciding the names and specifications of all the
functions and implementing some of the functions.  Your job is to implement
the rest of the functions. You will verify your implementation using
testing code that we provide.  Along the way, you will learn about Python
collections.
</p>

<p>
<b>Don't panic!</b>  This assignment might look long, but we have already
done most of the work for you.  You only have to implement 10 functions
— and we have already written the documentation and
tests for those functions, so you know exactly what to do and you know
whether your solution is correct.  The staff implementation of those 10
function bodies consists of only 63 lines of code in total, and 8 of the 10
functions have a body consisting of 6 or fewer lines of code.
<!--
 (defvar sizes '(6 6 4 11 5 6 9 4 6 6))
 (length sizes)
 (apply 'average sizes)
 (apply '+ sizes)
-->
Your solution might be smaller or larger, and that is fine; we mention the
size only to give you a feel for the approximate amount of code you have
to write.  While solving this assignment, you should expect to spend more
time <em>thinking</em> than <em>programming</em>.
</p>

<p>
Hint: Before you implement any function, try describing the algorithm in English
and hand-simulating it on some sample data.  If you need help, ask us!  You can
use the <a href="https://moodle.evergreen.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=88350">Moodle forum</a>,
the <a href="ada.evergreen.edu/csf/python13f">chat channel</a>, or e-mail the
professor or the TA, e-mail addresses also on the <a href="ada.evergreen.edu/csf/python13f">course website</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="problem0">Problem 0: Obtain the files, add your name</h3>

<p>
Obtain the files you need:   Downloading the
<a href="../homework/homework5.zip">homework5.zip</a> file, then unzip it to create a
<tt>homework5</tt> directory/folder on your computer.
</p>

<p>
You will do your work by modifying two files — <tt>election.py</tt> and
<tt>reflection.txt</tt> — and then submitting the modified versions.
<b>Add your name and Evergreen login to the top of each file.</b>
</p>

<p>
We provide you with the following election data (in the directory
<tt>homework5/data</tt>):
</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>data/2008-polls.csv</tt>: Polling data from the 2008 US presidential election.</li>
<li><tt>data/2008-results.csv</tt>: Results from the 2008 election.</li>
<li><tt>data/2012-polls.csv</tt>: Polling data from the 2012 election.</li>
<li><tt>data/2012-results.csv</tt>: Results from the 2012 election. <br>
<i>These results should not be used to predict the 2012 election. They are
included to evaluate the accuracy of your predictions.</i></li>
<li><tt>data/2012-electoral-college.csv</tt>: Name, population, and electoral
votes of each state in 2012.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You do not have to open or examine any of these files.  The staff has
already provided you with all the code that reads files.  (It's the 
<tt>read_csv</tt> function at the top of <tt>election.py</tt>; 
it uses a <tt>DictReader</tt> from Python's <tt>csv</tt> library.)  You will
only write functions that manipulate data structures such as lists and
dictionaries.
</p>

<p>
We describe the files here for completeness, but you can skip the rest of
this section if you are not interested.
</p>

<p>
Each file represents a table, in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> 
format: rows are on separate lines, and columns are separated by commas. The first
row in each file contains the name of each column.
You can open a CSV file using or using a 
spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft
Excel (though a spreadsheet program display the file differently than its
actual contents!).
<b>Be careful not to make any changes when examining these files.</b>
(Microsoft Excel or another program might encourage you to save the files
in a different format; do not do so!)
</p>

<p>Each row in the provided <b>polling data</b> (<tt>2008-polls.csv</tt> and
<tt>2012-polls.csv</tt>) contains a prediction of the Democratic and Republican
popular vote percentages in a single state.  Each row also contains the name of the
pollster that conducted the poll and the date the poll was conducted.</p>

<p>Each row in the provided <b>election data</b> (<tt>2008-results.csv</tt> and
<tt>2012-results.csv</tt>) contains the actual Democratic and Republican popular
vote percentages.</p>


<h3 id="problem1">Problem 1: State edges</h3>

<p>
Let's begin with a simple task: transforming a list of election result
rows into a more elegant Python data structure: a dictionary.
</p>

<p>Your program will represent the result of a state election in terms
of the “Democratic edge”, or the difference between the Democratic and Republican
popular vote percentages in that state.
For example, if the Democratic candidate receives 53% of the vote (actual
or predicted), and the Republican candidate receives 47% of the vote, then
the Democratic edge is 6 (percentage points).
A positive edge indicates a Democratic lead,
and a negative edge indicates a Republican lead. The sign associated with each party is
<!-- Actually, the sign is not arbitrary, but is consistent with that used by
  combinatorial game theory.  But the students don't need to know that. -->
arbitrary — no positive or negative connotation is intended.</p>

<p>
Throughout our program, we will frequently need to look up the Democratic
edge (hereinafter referred to simply as “edge”) in a particular
state. Instead of tediously searching through a list of election data rows
to find a particular state, let us instead produce a dictionary that maps
each state to its edge. The <tt>state_edges</tt> function serves this
purpose.  Read its documentation in the <tt>election.py</tt> file.
</p>

<p>The docstring for <tt>state_edges</tt> (the triple-quoted text just below
the function declaration) is a concise summary of its input parameters and return
value, and how they relate to each other. This is known as a function's 
<b>specification</b>. On first inspection, the specification of <tt>state_edges</tt>
appears too concise: What exactly do we mean by “state edges”?</p>

<p>To avoid confusion about the various data structures used in this assignment,
we've given each structure a name, and precisely defined its purpose and
representation in Python. <b>A list of these structures can be found at the
<a href="#data-types">bottom of this document</a>.</b> There you will find a
definition of <a href="#state-edges">“state edges”</a>.
If you become confused about the parameters or return type of a function,
<b>read its specification, and look up any unfamiliar types in the list below.</b>
Another way to better understand a given function is to examine its tests
that appear in the file <tt>tests.py</tt>.  Those tests don't use exactly
the same data as when your program will predict the 2012 election, but they
do use data of exactly the same type, and you may find the tests' small examples
of input and output helpful in understanding a given function.
</p>


<p>
<b>In
<tt>election.py</tt>, implement the function <tt>state_edges</tt>.</b>
Remove these lines:
</p>
<pre>    #TODO: Implement this function
    pass
</pre>
<p>
and replace them by your implementation.
Be sure to take advantage of the provided <tt>row_to_edge</tt> function.</p>

<p>
You do not have to read or examine the <tt>.csv</tt> files for this or any
other problem in the assignment.
</p>


<h3 id="testing-your-implementation">Testing your implementation</h3>

<p>
<b>Uncomment the invocation of <tt>test_state_edges()</tt></b> near the end of
  file <tt>tests.py</tt>.  That is, change this line:
</p>
<pre>    #test_state_edges()
</pre>
<p>
to this:
</p>
<pre>    test_state_edges()
</pre>

<p>
Then, <b>run <tt>tests.py</tt></b> as a Python program.  You can do this by
opening <tt>tests.py</tt> in IDLE, then pressing F5 or selecting Run Module
from the Run menu.  (Alternately, you can type <tt>python tests.py</tt> at
the command line, but using IDLE is usually more convenient.)
</p>

<p>
The file <tt>tests.py</tt> contains Python code that verifies the
correctness of each function you write.  Every time you finish implementing
a function, you should uncomment the corresponding function call at the
bottom of <tt>tests.py</tt> and run <tt>tests.py</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If your implementation is correct, then running <tt>tests.py</tt> will
print “Tests passed.&amp;rdquo  If your implementation is incorrect, 
an error will be output; in this case, fix your implementation and re-run
<tt>tests.py</tt>, until your implementation passes the tests.
</p>

<p>
The error produced if your implementation has a bug will not be very
helpful.  For example, suppose that you press F5 (Run Module) in IDLE and
get an error such as
</p>
<pre>...
  File "tests.py", line 32, in test_state_edges
    assert state_edges(rows1) == {'WA': 0.9}
AssertionError
</pre>
<p>
This tells you that the value returned by the method call
<tt>state_edges(rows1)</tt> was <em>not</em> <tt>{'WA': 0.9}</tt> as it
should have been, but it does not tell you what the value was.
But, IDLE is now in the interpreter waiting for output, with all of your
program's functions defined.  You can type
</p>
<pre>state_edges( [{'State': 'WA', 'Dem': '1.0', 'Rep': '0.1'}] )
</pre>
<p>
to the Python interpreter to see the exact value that the call returned.
Using the Python interpreter in this way is very convenient:  you can
perform experiments, calling a function on whatever input you like to
better understand its behavior.
</p>


<h3 id="problem2">Problem 2: Find the most recent poll row</h3>

<p>Next, we turn our attention to polling data. Election sentiment ebbs and flows
in the months leading up to an election, and as a result older polls are much
less accurate than more recent polls. In order to prevent old poll data
from unduly influencing our prediction of the 2012 election, our program will only
consider the most recent poll from a pollster in a state.</p>

<p><b>Implement the function <tt>most_recent_poll_row</tt> for this purpose.</b>
We provide a function <tt>earlier_date</tt>, which compares dates formatted as strings.
Make use of this function when implementing <tt>most_recent_poll_row</tt>. If you're
stuck, think back to how we found the maximum element in a list. In a sense,
<tt>most_recent_poll_row</tt> is finding the “maximum” of a list of 
dates.  As with any function, if you are having any trouble, step away from
IDLE, write a set of English instructions, and manually animate your
algorithm on some sample data.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to uncomment the call of <tt>test_most_recent_poll_row</tt> at
the bottom of <tt>tests.py</tt>, and run the tests.
</p>


<h3 id="problem3">Problem 3: Pollster predictions</h3>

<p>Now that we can obtain the most recent poll by a particular pollster in a
particular state, we can consider how to represent polling data within Python.</p>

<p>An election poll has two pieces of identifying information (“keys”):
a state and a pollster. Thus, our Python representation should make it easy to
look up a poll given both keys. <b>Nesting a dictionary within another dictionary
is a common way to facilitate lookup with multiple keys</b>. For example, here is a 
nested dictionary representation, which we call a
<a href="#pollster-predictions">pollster prediction</a>:</p>

<pre>{ 
  "pollster1": {"WA": 10.0, "OR": 15.0},
  "pollster2": {"OR": -5.0, "TX": -15.0}
}               
</pre>

<p>A value can be looked up in a nested dictionary using two pairs of brackets:</p>

<pre>edge = pollster_prediction["pollster1"]["WA"]
</pre>

<p>
In the above, note that <tt>pollster_prediction["pollster1"]</tt> is a dictionary
that maps each state to an edge.
</p>


<p>Alternatively, we could reverse the keys, and nest a dictionary of pollster
edges inside a dictionary of states; we call this a <a href="#state-predictions">state prediction</a>:</p>

<pre>{
  "WA": {"pollster1": 10.0}
  "OR": {"pollster1": 15.0, "pollster2": -5.0}
  "TX": {"pollster2": -15.0}
}

edge = state_prediction["WA"]["pollster1"]          
</pre>

<p>
In the above, note that <tt>state_prediction["WA"]</tt> is a dictionary
that maps each pollster to an edge.
</p>

<p>
<b>Each representation is better suited for different types of lookup.</b>
If you have a pollster, and you want to obtain all the state predictions
associated with that pollster, the first data structure is most
convenient. Conversely, if you have a state, and you want to obtain all the
pollster predictions in that state, the second data structure is more
convenient.
Your program will use both types of nesting. 
</p>

<p>
First, <b>implement the helper function <tt>unique_column_values</tt>.</b>
This produces a collection of states and a collection of pollsters to
iterate over.  You will need this in order to use the
<tt>most_recent_poll_row</tt> function that you previously implemented in
<a href="#problem2">Problem 2</a>.  As a hint, consider how different
Python data structures handle duplicate elements.
</p>

<p>
Next, <b>implement the
<tt>pollster_predictions</tt> function.</b>
Its output produces the first example of nesting described in this problem.
(In <a href="#problem5">Problem 5</a>, you will implement a function that
transforms one nesting into another.)  Your implementation of
<tt>pollster_predictions</tt> will use the helper function
<tt>most_recent_poll_row</tt> that you just implemented.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to refer to the <a href="#data-types">data type reference</a>
if you are unsure about what data structure to return, and don't forget to
uncomment and run the tests.
</p>


<h3 id="problem4">Problem 4: Pollster errors</h3>

<p>Now that we can represent election results and polling data in Python, we can
begin to implement Nate Silver's algorithm. A first step is to write a function
that computes the rank (average error) of a pollster's predictions.</p>

<p><b>Implement the function <tt>average_error</tt></b>, which computes the average
error of pollster edges. In each state, the error of a predicted edge is the <em>absolute
value</em> of the difference between the predicted edge and actual edge. The average error
of a collection of pollster edges is the average of these individual errors.</p>

<p>Hint:  <b>Not all pollsters conduct polls in every state.</b> When computing an average
error,  be sure to divide by the number of states in which a pollster made a prediction,
not by the total number of states.</p>

<p>Next, <b>use <tt>average_error</tt> to implement the function <tt>pollster_errors</tt>.
</b>Again, refer to the data type reference below for more information about parameter
and return types. Once completed, <tt>pollster_errors</tt> provides a quantitative method
for measuring the accuracy of a pollster, based on their past predictions.</p>

<h3 id="problem5">Problem 5: Pivot a nested dictionary</h3>

<p>Recall that in Problem 3, we implemented a function that produces a <a href="#pollster-predictions">pollster
prediction</a> (a nested dictionary from pollster to state to edge). This nesting
was ideal when implementing <tt>pollster_errors</tt>, however future problems will
require the opposite nesting. <b>Implement and test the function <tt>pivot_nested_dict</tt>,
which converts pollster predictions to state predictions.</b></p>

<p>
Hint:  the <tt>in</tt> operator indicates whether a dictionary
contains a key.
</p>

<h3 id="problem6">Problem 6: Average the edges in a single state</h3>

<p>So far, we have focused on representing election and polling data in Python,
and analyzing the accuracy of predictions from past elections. Now, we look to the
future!</p>

<p>
When predicting the election result in a single state, predictions from
multiple pollsters are combined using a weighted average, where a
pollster's prediction is weighted according to the accuracy of its past
predictions. First, <b>implement and test the helper function
<tt>weighted_average</tt>.</b>
A weighted average is defined as follows
(images of formulas courtesy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean">Wikipedia</a>):</p>

<p>For a list of items x:</p>
<img src="./hw5_files/weighted_avg_1.png" alt="list of items x">

<p>and a corresponding list of weights w:</p>
<img src="./hw5_files/weighted_avg_2.png" alt="list of weights w">

<p>the weighted average of x is:</p>
<img src="./hw5_files/weighted_avg_3.png" alt="definition of weighted average">

<p>
After implementing and testing <tt>weighted_average</tt>, use it to
<b>implement <tt>average_edge</tt>.</b>
We provide the function <tt>pollster_to_weight</tt>, which you should use to compute
the weight of a pollster, based on their average error.</p>


<!--
<p>
There are some imperfections in the 2012 polling data.  These do not affect
the code you write (we have already taken care of the details), but we
mention them here for completeness.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some pollsters in the 2012 election are absent from the 2008 polling data, and thus
  are not assigned a weight by <tt>pollster_weights</tt>. In these cases, we assume the pollster
  has an average error of 5%. The provided function <tt>pollster_to_weight</tt>
  handles this detail for you, so you do not need to worry about this.</li>
  <li>Polling data from the 2012 election is not available for Alaska, Delaware,
  and Wyoming, most likely because the electoral outcome in these states was easily
  predictable using other sources of data. To address this shortcoming, we
  have added a pollster &ldquo;2008Election&rdquo; to <tt>2012-polls.csv</tt>, which predicts
  that the popular vote percentages in these three states will be identical to the
  2008 election.</li>
</ul>
-->


<h3 id="problem7">Problem 7: Predict the 2012 election</h3>

<p>Finally, <b>implement the function <tt>predict_state_edges</tt>,</b> which
predicts the result of the 2012 election in each state. Make use of the
<tt>average_edge</tt> function from Problem 6.</p>

<p>
Once your implementation <tt>predict_state_edges</tt> passes our tests,
<b>run <tt>election.py</tt> as a Python program to predict the outcome of the
2012 election!</b>  
Your result should match the actual outcome of the 2012 election:
</p>
<pre>Dem 332.0
Rep 206.0
</pre>

<p>
If your program passes all the tests, but does not give this answer, then
please send your program to the course staff, who will create an additional
test case to help you find your error.
</p>

<p>
More details about the actual election appear in file 
<tt>data/2012-results.csv</tt> and in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012">Wikipedia
  article on the 2012 election</a>.

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection and submitting your work</h3>

<p>Make sure to look over <tt>election.py</tt> and <tt>tests.py</tt> for
any remaining <tt>TODO</tt> comments (the find feature in IDLE works great).
This should help you ensure you have completed the entire assignment.</p>

<p>In <tt>reflection.txt</tt>, state which students or other people
(besides the course staff) helped you with the assignment, or that no one did.</p>
