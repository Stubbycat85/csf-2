<h2>
Manifesto
</h2>

<p>
Programming is a tool for expressing your values in a creative, useful way
using computers.
Like other human artifacts, programs can be interesting in themselves
in addition to performing useful tasks.
In this thread you will learn how empowering it is to think 
with computers and how to use them to solve problems using information
from everyday life.
These datasets could come from political elections,
scientific experiments, popular websites, or even your own life.
To solve these problems, you will incidentally learn the basics of a
programming language called Python, how to work with software tools and
files, debugging skills, graphical plotting and data visualization,
and social coding practices.

<h2>
Meeting Times and Activities
</h2>

<h3>
Mondays 1pm-3pm, Sem II A1107
</h3>

<p>
<b>
Puzzle-Solving, Academic Statement Work, and Open-Ended Discussion
aka <b>Workshop and Seminar</b>.
</b>
</p>

<p>
This period consists of a mix of three main activities: solving
puzzles, writing your academic statement, and discussing programming
in seminar.
</p>

<p>
The first activity develops intuition and skills in math, logic, and
symbolic reasoning. This is to solve mathematical,
logical, or symbolic games and riddles puzzles, riddles,
and games that are mathematical, logical, or symbolic in nature.
This will aid you in your work in the Discrete Math thread, as well as
make you a better programmer. You'll be able to detect bad arguments in
real-life, make good arguments (and win!),
enlighten your friends, and confound your enemies.
</p>

<p>
This will alternate with the second activity,
six hours of work on your Academic Statement,
which is a new graduation requirement.
</p>

<p>
The third activity, which will be interspersed with the first two,
is an open-ended seminar discussion in small groups. The discussion
will motivate the practice of programming by beginning with a
chosen topic and allowing students to generate questions and
guide their own learning.
The topic for the coming week (listed above) will be motivated by first
presenting a short problem statement, possibly the homework assignment for
that week, and then working backwards to construct the necessary concepts.
Be prepared for awkward silences, animated discussion, intense thought,
confusion, and understanding.
</p>

<h3>
Tuesdays 10am-12noon, LH 05
</h3>

<p>
<b> Inspiration and Interaction, Live Coding on stage,
and Guest Speakers, (aka Lecture)
</b>
</p>

<h3>
Thursdays 10am-12noon, 1pm - 3pm, 3pm - 5pm Lib 2610 (ACC)
</h3>

<p>
<b>
Design Critique and Programming Practice (aka Lab)
</b>
</p>

<p>
These are smaller class meetings than the lecture and more
interactive. We will begin with a design critique, where students
will post a printout of their code (their solutions to the
homework assigned the previous week)
on a wall and practice giving and
receiving feedback to each other under my guidance. This
feedback is for programming style, and not necessarily correctness.
This practice is inspired by critiques in art and design classes.
</p>

<p>
Next, students will grade each others programming homework for
correctness by running their submissions on computers in the lab.
</p>

<p>
After that, students will take an individual written quiz on paper
to demonstrate their knowledge of coding gained that week. This is the
only exercise in class where collaboration is not allowed. This is a
short program that they will grade in-class by typing it into a
Python interpreter and providing feedback to each other.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I will introduce the next programming homework for the following
week, and students can begin working on it.
</p>

<p>
Student only need attend one of the following lab sessions according to
this schedule.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>
Collaboration
</h2>

<p>
You are allowed to discuss and share code at all times, including using
code from the internet, except during individual written exercises on
Thursdays.
Please name all your contributors or sources in the comments of your
submitted code, to give them proper credit, and be prepared to understand
or discuss any
line of your code during design critique. If you have any questions at any
time about what is acceptable collaboration, please talk to me or the TA.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>
Assignments
</h2>

<p>
There are four types of assignments. Check the <a href="prog1-calendar.html">Calendar</a>
for authoritative due dates, or pay attention to announcements in class.
<ol>
<li>math puzzles (most weeks), due in-class on Monday</li>
<li>a journal entry (some weeks), due on Moodle on Friday at 5pm</li>
<li>individual written quiz (some weeks), usually due in-class on Thursday</li>
<li>programming homework (most weeks), due using <a href="github.html">GitHub</a>
on Fridays at 5:00pm</li>
</ol>

All assignments will be graded and
will prompt feedback from students to their peers, under my
guidance. I will personally grade a statistical sampling of all
student work, but all students are expected to complete all assignments.
I will also do all of these assignments along with the students,
either to provide a model before they hand in their assignment,
or as an answer key after they submit their solutions.
</p>

<p>
The due days and times given will be strictly observed for counting
work as on-time. Late assignments will be accepted for credit, but
they will be noted as late in your end-of-quarter evaluation.
</p>

<p>
The math puzzles are assigned in the Monday workshops and are meant to
be completed within an hour while working in a group. Any individual
must be able to explain their solution to another group. Paper handouts
will be given in workshop. Attendance will be taken by submitting
paper submissions by the end of class, at which time I will also provide
solutions on paper.
</p>

<p>
The journal entries are due on Moodle by Friday at 5pm. More
specific instructions will be posted here soon. They are
considered a form of creative expression and a test of technical
writing skill.
They can be up to three paragraphs in length and should address
the following items over the course of the past week:

<ul>
<li>What specific concepts and ideas you learned</li>
<li>What new questions were raised that you are curious about and want
to learn more about in the coming weeks</li>
<li>How the items above will help you
achieve your programming goals</li>
<li>Connections to previous journal entries.</li>
</ul>

I will write my own journal entry, documenting my own experience
in preparing and executing the class, and present it to the class as
a model in lecture on Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
The individual written quiz are given in Thursday labs after grading
the programming homework for the past week. Students will solve a
short 
programming problem (up to 4 lines of code) on paper meant to exercise a
concept taught
in the past week, without the aid of interactive computer feedback.
Quizzes will be graded in-class by students, and then returned the
following week.
</p>

<p>
The programming homework is the longest and most involved of the
assignments. It requires writing a Python program of up to 100 lines of
code to solve a relatively open-ended problem related to data
processing. It is due using the csf_submit program on Wednesday night
at 11:59pm, otherwise it will be counted as late.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>
Credit and Attendance
</h2>

<p>
Credit will be granted on an all-or-nothing basis for the
Problem-Solving Workshop thread and the Introductory Programming thread.
You must complete
all (one hundred percent) of the work listed in the Assignments section
above
by the end of the quarter in order to
receive credit. Assignments can be submitted late, but they will be
noted as such in end-of-quarter evaluations.
</p>

<p>
Attendance will be taken at every class meeting. If a student
misses too many consecutive meetings, we will try to contact you.
Missing attendance or late arrivals will not affect your credit, but
it will be noted in your evaluations.
</p>

<p>
I intend to help every student pass this class who is willing to put
in the extra work. Your current progress towards getting credit is
reflected in your Moodle grade report. If you have any questions
at any time about your progress in this class, please feel free to
contact me or the TA.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>
Limiting Distractions
</h2>

<p>
During the lecture period (Tuesday mornings) no personal electronic
devices will be allowed (no personal laptops, no phones, no tablets,
no MP3 players). All notes should be taken on paper, so stock up on
analog writing tools like pens and pencils. Ironic, I know, for a class
presumably about computers.
</p>

<p>
All interactive programming exercises during this time will be done on
provided ChromeBooks shared in groups of three.
You are asked not to use the ChromeBooks for personal reasons (Gmail,
Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Reddit, etc.) and
not to sign into your personal Google account on the ChromeBooks
(use the guest account only). I ask you and your group partners to help
maintain each other's attention on the lecture.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>
Optional Activities
</h2>

<p>
There are two optional activities throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
The first activity is reading the recommended book for the class,
Lauren Ipsum by Carlos Ytalo-Buena (fact-check). This is a whimsical
book about computer science which uses no computers in the style of Alice
in Wonderland. It is purely meant for enjoyment and to prompt deeper
questions and discussions in class. It is sold out at the Greener Store,
but you can <a href="http://www.laurenipsum.org/">buy it online</a>.
</p>

<p>
The second activity is dinner. Throughout the year, I'll invite you in
groups of four or five to my home for potluck dinners.
Each of you will receive exactly one surprise personal paper invitation
at the postal address you provide on the first day of class, on some
unannounced date.
Attendance is completely optional and will not affect your credit or
evaluation in any way, but I do ask for prompt RSVP (which I will accept
electronically).
</p>

<p>
This will be an opportunity for philosophical discussions and candid
questions and answers about anything and everything: the CSF program,
Lauren Ipsum, computer science in general, jobs, life, music for robots,
Evergreen, you name it.
Dinner will be preceded by a brief work session where you are asked to
help me do planning and provide feedback for the coming week.
</p>
