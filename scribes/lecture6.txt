Programming Notes: Nov 5, 2013

*Now requiring attendance for programming lecture!
*Office Hours: Wednesday 3-4 in Lib2611

Data structures in Python:
-lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries.

Office hours: Wednesday LIB 2611 3-4pm
Lab Hours: Thursday 10-11am, 1-2pm, 3-4pm

Python Anywhere:
-Can access a command line from anywhere.

"This isn't a community college, so we aren't always going to have a clear direction;
we need to be okay with experimenting."

Scope: What is the scope of a variable?
-The section of the code that can access the variable.
=Scope can be thought of as like the different levels of indentations in code.

Kinds of scope: (dreams inside of dreams)
-Module <--> first level of indentation, file ending in .py, can be imported
-Functions: "def square(x):", this is a new scope (dream), creates new indent, returns a value
=Indentations are important in Python! Either 4 spaces or a tab for each indent.
=Programs are read line-by-line, so ordering matters as well. You cannot call a variable until
it has been defined in that scope. Scopes inside scopes inherit values and variables from parent scope.
-While, for loops create a new scope
-if, else statements create new scopes, "if(x>0):"

Why Scopes?:
-Reuse variable names
-organize program
-limit accidental modification

Programming exercise:
Sort a shuffled list of 100 elements or guess a random number.

Data Structures:
-lists: daily_tasks["wake up", "eat", "brush teeth", "bike", "teach", ....]
=have certain operations that can be performed on them.
*len(daily_tasks) = gives cardinality of the list.
*daily_tasks[i] = provides a specific element in a list.
*daily_tasks.append("dream") = adds an element to a list.  
*del - removes item in a list
